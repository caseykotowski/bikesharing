# bikesharing

## Overview

This is a data visualization for a bike sharing start up proposal. We want to take a business model like citibike, and take it to Des Moines, IA. 
Citibike provides a large amount of data for their New York locations, and my team believes we can extrapolate that data to this new location. I created a Tableau story to demonstrate this data.

## Results

I have seven visualizations. [Here is my Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kotowski/viz/bikesharing_challenge_16246512321000/Citibike-AugustinNewYork)

* August Peak Hours - Peak hours for August are during work commute hours

* Checkout by Gender - The majority of users are men, but trip duration doesn't change with gender

* Starting Locaiton Frequency - Are the starting locations where the majority of people in New York live?

* Trips by Weekday - The most trips are during the week, and show standard commuting hours

* Trips by Gender - Men and Women check out bikes at the same times during the day

* Trips by User Types - Subscribers represent the vast majority of users

* Trip Duration - Most trips last under 20 minutes

## Summary

In summary, Citibike NY caters most of their business towards daily commuters. This is promising news for moving this business to Des Moines. Iowa does not recieve nearly as many tourists as New York City, but does have a large number of jobs within biking distance of residential buildings. To confirm this, I would like to create two more visualizations:

* Trips per user per Month
  *  This would show how often the repeat customers use their subscriptions
*  Bike maintenance activity per mile of use
  *   how many miles does the average bike go before needing maintenance? 

Assuming there are bike trails, paths, and lanes, I am confident that Citibike would do well in Des Moines, IA.
